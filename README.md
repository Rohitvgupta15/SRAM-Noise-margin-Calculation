# 🧠 SRAM Static Noise Margin (SNM) Extraction Using Python

This repository contains a Python script for extracting and visualizing the **Static Noise Margin (SNM)** of a 6T SRAM cell from **butterfly curves**.  
The script reads voltage transfer characteristics from a CSV file and automatically identifies the **largest possible square** that fits between the two inverter curves—representing the SNM.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📂 **Reads CSV data** containing butterfly curve points (`hold.csv`)
- 📈 **Interpolates** upper and lower inverter characteristics using cubic splines for smooth curves
- 🔍 **Automatically detects** the largest inscribed square between the two curves for accurate SNM computation
- 🧮 **Computes SNM** and diagonal length:
  - Upper and lower SNM values  
  - Effective SNM (minimum of both)
- 🎨 **Plots** the butterfly curve with:
  - Interpolated smooth curves  
  - Maximum squares and diagonals  
  - Highlighted intersection points

## 🧠 What is Static Noise Margin (SNM)?

The **Static Noise Margin (SNM)** represents the maximum noise voltage that can be tolerated by an SRAM cell without flipping its stored state.  

In this script:
- The butterfly curve is generated by plotting the voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of both inverters  
- The **largest square** that can fit between the two VTCs indicates the SNM  
- The **side length of this square** corresponds to the SNM value

## 📊 Input File Format

The script expects a CSV file (e.g., `hold.csv`) with **four columns**:

| Q_lower | Qbar_lower | Q_upper | Qbar_upper |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| x₁ | y₁ | x₂ | y₂ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

> **Note:** No header row is required. Each column represents the voltage points for the lower and upper inverters.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sram-snm-extraction.git
   cd sram-snm-extraction
   ```

2. Place your data file (e.g., `hold.csv`) in the same directory as the script  

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python snm_extraction.py
   ```

4. View the butterfly plot and SNM results printed in the terminal

## 🧮 Example Output

**Terminal Output:**
```
==== SRAM SNM Results ====
Case: Both squares fitted
Upper SNM square side = 0.1425 V
Lower SNM square side = 0.1389 V
Static Noise Margin (SNM) = 0.1389 V
Diagonal of SNM square = 0.1964 V
```

## 🧪 Example Visualization

The plot will show:
- 🔴 **Red curve**: lower inverter characteristic  
- 🔵 **Blue curve**: upper inverter characteristic  
- ⚫ **Dashed black/magenta boxes**: fitted SNM squares  
- 🟢 **Green and cyan diagonals**: SNM diagonals

## 🧩 Python Code Overview

### Main Steps:
1. **Load CSV Data**
   - Reads lower and upper inverter transfer characteristics  
2. **Interpolate Smooth Curves**
   - Uses `scipy.interpolate.interp1d()` with cubic interpolation  
3. **Find Maximum Square**
   - Determines the largest square that fits between the two inverter curves  
4. **Compute SNM**
   - Calculates the side and diagonal length of the maximum square  
5. **Plot Results**
   - Displays the butterfly curves and fitted SNM squares with legends
